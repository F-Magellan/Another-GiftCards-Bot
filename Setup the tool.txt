Hey, first of all in the config folder open 2 sub folders, one that is the bot and another that is the command cooldown
In the bot folder in their respective TXT you put your token, prefix and the bot's RPC
In the cooldown folder you will put the per and rate
Per = the amount of seconds the cooldown lasts
Rate = how many times the command can be used before triggering the cooldown

In the file commands.txt will be the bot commands and there are also 2 help type commands
